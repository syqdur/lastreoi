# Wedding Gallery App

## Overview

This is a full-stack wedding gallery application built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL. The app provides an Instagram-style interface for wedding guests to share photos, videos, and messages during the wedding celebration. It features real-time interactions, Spotify integration for music requests, and comprehensive admin controls.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server:
