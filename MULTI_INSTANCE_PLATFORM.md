# WeddingPix Multi-Instance Wedding Gallery Platform

## Project Overview

Successfully evolved WeddingPix from a single wedding gallery into a comprehensive multi-instance platform where users can create their own isolated, private gallery instances.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🎯 Core Multi-Instance Architecture
- **Landing Page**: Clean, modern landing page with gallery creation form
- **Dynamic Routing**: Gallery-specific URLs (e.g., `/julia-und-tim`)
- **Gallery Creation**: Simple form with event name, optional password, date range
- **Data Isolation**: Each gallery has completely separate data storage
- **Gallery Authentication**: Password protection with secure validation

### 🔐 Security & Privacy
- **Private by Default**: All galleries are private and isolated
- **Password Protection**: Optional password-based access control
- **Gallery-Specific Firebase Rules**: Multi-tenant security rules
- **Data Encryption**: Secure data transfer with Firebase
- **Owner Controls**: Gallery owners can manage settings and content

### 🎨 Full Feature Set Per Gallery
Each gallery instance includes:
- **Instagram-style Feed**: Photos, videos, notes with likes and comments
- **24h Stories**: Auto-deleting stories with view tracking
- **Live User Tracking**: Real-time presence indicators
- **Spotify Integration**: Music wishlist with song requests
- **Interactive Timeline**: Wedding milestones and events
- **User Profiles**: Custom avatars and display names
- **Admin Panel**: Content moderation and gallery controls
- **Notifications**: Real-time push notifications for interactions

### 📱 Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive UI**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large touch targets and smooth interactions
- **Offline Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized asset loading and caching

### 🚀 Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Architecture
- **React + TypeScript**: Type-safe component architecture
- **Router-Based**: Dynamic routing with `wouter`
- **Component Isolation**: Gallery-aware components
- **Service Layer**: Separate services for each gallery
- **State Management**: React hooks with gallery context

#### Backend Architecture
- **Firebase Firestore**: Gallery-specific collections (`galleries/{galleryId}/...`)
- **Firebase Storage**: Isolated file storage per gallery
- **Express.js Server**: RESTful API with gallery support
- **PostgreSQL**: User management with Drizzle ORM
