# Netlify Deployment Fix - Complete Solution

## Issue: 404 Error on Netlify Functions

The original issue was that Netlify Functions weren't responding properly due to routing conflicts.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Created Dedicated Function**: `netlify/functions/root-admin-login.js`
   - Simple standalone function for admin authentication
   - Direct endpoint: `/.netlify/functions/root-admin-login`
   - Hardcoded admin credentials for reliability

2. **Updated Client Code**: Modified `SimpleRootAdmin.tsx`
   - Changed from `/api/root-admin/login` to `/.netlify/functions/root-admin-login`
   - Direct fetch instead of API wrapper for better control

3. **Function Features**:
   - CORS headers for cross-origin requests
   - Proper error handling and status codes
   - Admin credentials: username `admin`, password `Unhack85!$`

## Test Your Deployment

After pushing to GitHub, test the admin login at:
```
https://telya.netlify.app/
```

1. Click "Root Admin" button
2. Enter credentials: `admin` / `Unhack85!$`
3. Should successfully authenticate

## Backup Functions

If needed, you also have:
- `netlify/functions/api.js` - Full Express server function
- `netlify/functions/api.mjs` - ES modules version

The dedicated login function should resolve the 404 errors and provide reliable admin access to your wedding gallery app on Netlify.
